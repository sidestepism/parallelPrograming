1. 

s +=(first add) x *(mul) x;
x +=(second add) dx;

mul: vmulpd  %ymm2, %ymm2, %ymm2 (in integral1.s)
first add: vhaddpd %xmm2, %xmm2, %xmm3 (in integral1.s)
second add: vaddsd  %xmm8, %xmm3, %xmm3 (in integral1.s)

2.
the throughput-imposed limit can be calclated as below:

throughput of vhaddpd and vmulpd are 0.5
	
3.
the latency-imposed limit can be calculated as below: 

total latency = 3(vhaddpd) + 5(vmulpd) = 8 cycles
n/loop = 4

obtained cycles/n = 8/4 = 2.0
